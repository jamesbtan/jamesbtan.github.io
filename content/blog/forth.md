An exploration into stack-based interpreters.
<!-- more -->

## Motivation
I had enjoyed some Lisp systems and the meta-programming aspect has always seemed powerful,
if difficult to harness.
However, Forth seems even more unruly.
They say that to truly understand Forth you need to write a Forth, so my attempts are documented below.

I've decided to implement Forth-y interpreters in different languages
with varying levels of abstraction,
with the thought that I would be able to first come to an understanding
of the high-level architecture of the interpreter,
and later come to terms with the more involved implementation details.

I also used the opportunity to try some languages that have seemed interesting,
but that I've never had a chance to actually use for anything.

## Iterations
- Python
- Nim
- Crystal
- Zig
- C
- WASM
- x64
