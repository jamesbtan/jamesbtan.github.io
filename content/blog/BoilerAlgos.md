An educational data-structures and algorithm sites, with interactive visualizations and quizzes

<!-- more -->

## Caveats
- The demo only provides the front-end functionality. I do not have the back-end deployed at this moment
    - Mainly, this means that the log-in functionality is not working, so you cannot save quiz scores etc.
- I had certain issues with publishing a React app into a subdirectory of my GH Pages site. So the React Router is not quite fully functional.
